Repository for the Debugging Numerical Software - Bath 4-5 Jun 2018

This repository is for bugs, and material developed as part of the Workshop on Debugging Numerical Software.

If you are submitted a bug for the workshop please fork the repository and create a folder under your (bug/codes) name.  Please add the source to this folder.  If it is not practical to do so, or the software is not open source, please contact the organisers, r.j.grant@bath.ac.uk or e.h.mueller@bath.ac.uk to discuss how best to include your example in the workshop. 

We also ask that you include two .tex files in a subdirectory (tex), the content of each should fit on a single slide.  The first should include a brief overview of the bug, which we will ask you to introduce at the start of the Bug Hunt, and include context for the code and bug, langauge, issue.  The second should summarise the solution e.g. how the bug was resolved (if it was), what methods were used, how long did it take and what was the impact of the bug.

If you then create a pull request, we will merge these into the main branch so that they will be available to attendees at the workshop and collate the tex into a single document for the introductions.
